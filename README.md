Inspiration
Mexico has many small health care providers and clinical laboratories that, on their own, cannot expensive equipment that would allow them to provide the highest quality care possible. The proliferation of digital and cloud technologies can help to solve this problem.

What it does
It solves the problem by linking the provider of the service to the clinic.

How we built it
Wordpress

Challenges we ran into
The limited information from the problem and the lack of experience in the field of the team.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working as a team to build the project.

What we learned
The problem to solve is something one as a non health care professional would ignore. We're glad to provide a solution.

What's next for LabCloud:
Keep working on the MVP!! and show it to investors!! This is a problem that has a great market impact!
